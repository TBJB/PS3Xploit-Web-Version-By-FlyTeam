	The code was heavily modified but the userland memory leak exploit poc by xerpi provided a perfect basis for this work.
	Another UAF exploit was added onto it in order to get userland code execution via ROP to defeat NX (DEP).
	With many thanks to Joonie & zecoxao for their regular advice, friendly support & extra testing...<br><br>
